      <h2>About Us:</h2>
        <p class="aboutcossie">CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create  outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from  simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced  features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force  fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and  cost between $10 and $10,000.<br><br>
          We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a  price list is available) as well.<br>
          On the first Saturday of every month we  hold a &ldquo;CossiePlay Party&rdquo; at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for  ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic  drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is  always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but  not required).      </p>

    <p>What is CosPlay?<br>
Cosplay, a portmanteau of the words costume play, is a performance art in which participants called cosplayers wear costumes and fashion accessories to represent a specific character. Cosplayers often interact to create a subculture and a broader use of the term "cosplay" applies to any costumed role-playing in venues apart from the stage. Any entity that lends itself to dramatic interpretation may be taken up as a subject and it is not unusual to see genders switched. Favorite sources include manga and anime, comic books and cartoons, video games, and live-action films and television series. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosplay" target="_blank">(More info..)</a> </p>
