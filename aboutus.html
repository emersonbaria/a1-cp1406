      <h2>About Us:</h2>
        <p class="aboutcossie">CossiePlay is a family-run business, operating in Hulkstown since 2012. We create  outstanding custom-made costumes. Cosplayers can order any kind of costume - from  simple Spiderman or elf costumes right up to costumes including advanced  features like armour, animatronics, realistic weaponry and working force  fields. Depending on the difficulty, costumes take between 1 and 50 weeks and  cost between $10 and $10,000.<br><br>
          We buy and sell second-hand costumes (a  price list is available) as well.<br>
          On the first Saturday of every month we  hold a &ldquo;CossiePlay Party&rdquo; at the town hall. Entry is $15 for adults, $10 for  ages 6-17 and kids under 6 are free. Each entry includes one non-alcoholic  drink and a glow stick. Parties start at 6pm and run until 11pm. There is  always a live DJ at the party (who takes requests) and dancing is common (but  not required).      </p>
